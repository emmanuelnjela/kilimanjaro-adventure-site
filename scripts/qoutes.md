Nature: much cheaper than therapy.

Leave nothing behind but footprints.

Life should have more mountains and less stress.

Live your life by a compass, not a clock.

The best view comes after the hardest climb.

Let’s find some beautiful place to get lost.

It’s not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.

Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.

You are not in the mountains. The mountains are in you.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

When excitement wells up inside my chest in a way that doesn’t happen in everyday life. Today my fingertips were cracked and bleeding. I made no progress despite great conditions. Now I am on the ground and can hardly contain my excitement to get back on the wall. It’s a crazy rollercoaster and I owe my family and partners a great deal for encouraging me through it all.”― Tommy Caldwell

“The fact that I’m three months pregnant doesn’t change anything.” – Catherine Destivelle
